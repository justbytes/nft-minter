# NFT Minter

## Overview

A NFT minter using the Open Zepplin ERC721 smart contract. In this project I used [Pinata]('https://www.pinata.cloud') to upload three images generated by [DALL-E]("https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2") from Open AI. The first NFT is minted when the contract initially deploys and the rest are deployed by using the mint.js.

## contract
